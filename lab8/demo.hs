    1. significance of static typing in Haskell (+ how to read a type annotation)
    2. type, data (simple + registration), newtype + parameterized types + type recursion
    3. getters and data constructors (and how to distinguish them from functions)
    4. practical examples (List, Tree, NestedList, AST for arithmetic expressions)
    5. name alias (@)
    6. already defined types ([], (,), Maybe, Either)

    Extra: what is an AST ?
    Extra 2: classes (lab9)
